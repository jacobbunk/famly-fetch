Fetch your (kid's) images from famly.co

**NOTICE: I no longer have access to Famly, so I am merely the steward of this
code base. If you create PRs with improvements or bugfixes, please make sure
to test them before submitting them.**

## Get Started

```
pip install famly-fetch
famly-fetch
```

Enter your email and password when prompted, or provide an access token for authentication. Run `famly-fetch --help` to
get full help page.

Downloaded images will be stored in the `pictures` directory of the
the folder where you run this program from.

By default, it will only download images where you have tagged your child. The
date that the photo was taken is embedded in its metadata and in its title.
For journey, notes and messages, the associated text is also added as an exif
comment unless disabled with `--no-text-comments`.

The images have been stripped for any metadata including EXIF
information by Famly. You can optionally add GPS coordinates to the EXIF
data of all downloaded images by providing latitude and longitude values.

The `--stop-on-existing` option is helpful if you wish to download
images continously and just want to download what is new since last
download.

### State management

famly-fetch tracks downloaded images in a state file to avoid re-downloading them.
By default, this state file is stored as `state.json` in your pictures folder.

You can customize the state file location using the `--state-file` option.

If you need to start over, simply delete (or move) the state file.

### Customizing Filenames

You can customize the filename format using the `--filename-pattern` option.
The pattern supports custom placeholders and standard strftime date/time formats.
The file extension is automatically appended.

**Custom placeholders:**

- `%FP` - Filename prefix (e.g., child name, "note", "message", "journey")
- `%ID` - Image ID

**Date/time formats:**
All standard strftime format codes are supported (e.g. `%Y`, `%m`, `%d` etc.)

**Default pattern:** `%FP-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S-%ID`

This produces filenames like: `child-name-2024-01-15_14-30-45-abc123.jpg`
